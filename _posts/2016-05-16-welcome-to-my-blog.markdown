Hello! 


My name is Anton Khodak, I am a 3rd-year student at Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, Ukraine, studying system analysis, and I am 2016 Google Summer of Code student from [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Main_Page). I am working on a project ["Automated CWL tool wrapper/converter"](http://obf.github.io/GSoC/ideas/#automated-tool-wrapperconverter-for-cwl) under guidance of [Roman Valls Guimer√†](https://github.com/brainstorm) and [Michael R. Crusoe](https://github.com/mr-c). Here is my original [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nuJBgIcBZGc5Mn-9aWn8jKomRkTCcfgIrnK61NoENfI/edit?usp=sharing) with a slightly updated timeline.

This blog is intended to track my progress on the way to the achievement of the project's objective. I will come up with weekly updates about what I observed, encountered and accomplished.

The primary goal this week (16.05 - 22.05) is to set development/reviewing process while working on wrapping tools from [CNVkit](https://github.com/etal/cnvkit/tree/f5b11882d68bb8d2236e3142d6ce297206b2b075). 

Let's go!
