On this week I have fixed a bunch of bugs from `pypi2cwl`, [the commit](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/gxargparse/commit/e5ab26d63be7797ae144fbf0026c83752bd61a0b).

In short:

* simplified Python 2 & 3 support

* fixed bugs with storage directory

* fixed incompatibility in `pip` versions, automatic 2to3 `setup.py` conversion in the bash script

* refactoring, updated comments and help messages

Then I have started working on the second subproject from post-midterm plan - `cwl2argparse`. I have made a working prototype, which generates argparse code from some of the model tools from [workflows](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/workflows). The source code is available [here](https://github.com/anton-khodak/cwl2argparse/commit/cb55ef8264f3b9ae5abb20aefc3e946acb202120), brief documentation in the README of the [repository](https://github.com/anton-khodak/cwl2argparse).


The next week I finish working on `cwl2argparse`: full `argparse` API coverage, some tests, pretty formatting. Also, I will be ready to proceed with a web-version of `pypi2cwl` or improving the command-line version.
