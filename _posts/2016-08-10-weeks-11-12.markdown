On these weeks I have been finishing working on `click2cwl`. In particular, I added the following:

* tests and fixes for bugs revealed by testing
* update `jinja2` templates to `CWL v1.0`
* support for multiple types and boolean flags

[Pull request](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/gxargparse/pull/14#commits-pushed-81f5cff) with an anchor to the latest commits.

Besides *click2cwl*, I have updated [cwl2argparse](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwl2argparse/) considering my mentor's [comments](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwl2argparse/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+author%3Amr-c). Changes include:

*  `-q/--quiet` option to suppress redundant output
* adding confirmation for overriding existing files
* updating CWL parser to `v1.0`
* fixing missing dependencies and Python 2 issues

[Commits](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwl2argparse/commits/master).

In general, I have completed everything I planned to do regarding all [subprojects of the second GSoC half](http://blogs.nopcode.org/brainstorm/2016/06/16/gsoc-2016-post-midterm). Ahead is a post-production period of getting users' feedback, tracking issues and fixing possible bugs.
